# Email Provider Project

## üéØ Project Overview

This project aims to create a complete email provider system similar to Gmail, built from scratch as a learning experience. The goal is to understand email infrastructure, protocols, and system architecture through hands-on implementation.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** All keys, credentials, and sensitive information will be published in this repository. This project is for educational purposes only. **DO NOT use this email provider for any crucial or sensitive communications.**

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

Based on the provided architecture diagram, our email system follows the standard email flow:

### Email Sending Process (Left to Right)

```
Client (MUA) ‚Üí SMTP Client (MSA) ‚Üí SMTP Server (MTA & MDA)
```

1. **Client (MUA)** - Mail User Agent (email client)
2. **SMTP Client (MSA)** - Mail Submission Agent
3. **SMTP Server (MTA & MDA)** - Mail Transfer Agent & Mail Delivery Agent

### Email Receiving Process (Right Section)

```
Incoming Email ‚Üí SMTP Server (MTA) ‚Üí MDA ‚Üí Client (via IMAP/POP3)
```

1. **SMTP Server** receives incoming emails
2. **MTA** (Mail Transfer Agent) processes the email
3. **MDA** (Mail Delivery Agent) stores the email
4. **Client** retrieves emails via IMAP or POP3 protocols

## üìö How Email Works

### Key Components & Protocols

```
| Acronym  | Full Name                        | Purpose                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **MUA**  | Mail User Agent                  | Email client (Outlook, Thunderbird, web interface)   |
| **MSA**  | Mail Submission Agent            | Accepts emails from clients for submission           |
| **MTA**  | Mail Transfer Agent              | Routes emails between servers                        |
| **MDA**  | Mail Delivery Agent              | Stores emails in user mailboxes                      |
| **SMTP** | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol    | Protocol for sending emails                          |
| **LMTP** | Local Mail Transfer Protocol     | Protocol for local mail delivery                     |
| **IMAP** | Internet Message Access Protocol | Protocol for retrieving emails (keeps on server)     |
| **POP3** | Post Office Protocol Version 3   | Protocol for retrieving emails (downloads to client) |
